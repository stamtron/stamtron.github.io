During my M.Eng. studies in NTUA, I had a first glimpse of Machine Learning and immediately became
excited about it. I am currently following a PhD in the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, working on
automating Subsea Survey Video Annotations using Deep Learning. During my PhD, I have had the
luck to be involved in Computer Vision projects of image and video classification, object detection and
instance segmentation. I see myself as a Machine Learning Engineer with focus on Applied Computer
Vision and I would like to work in a cooperative environment that will give me the opportunity to
improve my skills and eventually become an expert in the field.
